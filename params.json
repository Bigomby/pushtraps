When a TRAP is received, is forwarded to configured push services.\r\n\r\nThe app uses [SNMP4J library](http://www.snmp4j.org) for the communication with the SNAMPs agents.\r\n\r\n### Push services\r\n\r\nServices to forward the TRAPs. The currently supported devices are listed above.\r\n\r\n### Connections\r\n\r\nAfter you set an agent and a service you need to set a connection. Connections let you forward TRAPs from a specific agent to a specific push service.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
